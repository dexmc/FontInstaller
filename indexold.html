                array of fonts available for the user to choose from, allowing
                the user to choose what they prefer. To actually use the app,
                your phone <strong><em>must be rooted</em></strong>. In the app

                <p>We will be creating an Android app that allows users to pick
                from a large selection of custom fonts, and then install the
                one of their choice as the system typeface. In other words we
                will be developing a font installer app for Android. Other
                functionalities of the app include font previewing, backup and
                restore fonts, and view currently installed font. The app
                requires that your device is rooted (necessary in order to
                write new fonts into the system partition), and that it is
                running Android Ice Cream Sandwich or higher (Android 4.0+). In
                addition it is recommended that your device has at least 512MB
                of RAM, and a single core 1GHz processor or better. Sufficient
                storage space is also essential for the downloaded fonts to
                reside. The app will need access to the following
                permissions:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Modify or delete the contents of your SD card (to
                        store downloaded fonts)</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>Full permissions to all device features and storage
                        (root access needed to push fonts into system)</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>Download files without notification and full network
                        access (needed to contact server and download
                        fonts)</p>
                    </li>

                    <li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
                        <p>Based on our research we have come to an estimate
                        that approximately 1 percent of all Android devices are
                        rooted. The current number of Android device
                        activations is just over 1 billion, therefore about 10
                        million rooted Android devices exist. We must also take
                        into consideration that our app requires Android
                        version 4.0 or higher. This equates to 80 percent of
                        all devices running Android. Finally 80 percent of 10
                        million, results in 8 million devices. This number
                        represents the number of possible users for our app.
                        There is a large amount of Android users who are
                        greatly enthusiastic about changing the look of their
                        devices. Many consumers who buy into Android do so
                        primarily because of the wide range of customization
                        that the mobile operating system offers. This app will
                        extend the users control over their device and allow
                        them to personalize it further to their liking.</p>
